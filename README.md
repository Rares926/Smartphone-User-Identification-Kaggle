# Smartphone-User-Identification-Kaggle

The task is to discriminate between 20 mobile device users. For each user, there are 450 accelerometer signal recordings (examples) available for training. The signals are recorded for 1.5 seconds, while the user taps on the smartphone's screen. The accelerometer signal is recorded at 100 Hz, thus containing roughly 150 values. The values are recorded on three different axes: x, y, z.
